# Background
I've started experimenting with git hooks, and this is my collection of "useful" scripts that I've come up with. I'm sure this isn't the first time a collection like this has been compiled, but I couldn't find what I wanted within a few minutes of searching. So I made my own :)

# Further Documentation
For more information about the specifics of git hooks, you can review the official documentation here: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks

## TLDR
The short of it, though, is that your initialized git project should have a handful of sample hook scripts in the `.git/hooks/` subdirectory.
